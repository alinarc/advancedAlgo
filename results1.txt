For this first project the algorithm we implemented as the exhaustive algorithm. While simple on the surface, "execute every
possible option," there were many hurdles the team ran into in the execution. One roadblock was at first the group attempted
to write each possible combination into a vector, this proved to be extremely resource intensive an infeasible. The decision
was made instead to just hold the best combination at the time as a vector. Another problem arose when the larger sized 
variations were not yielding any results if cut off by the 600 second time limit. The source of this problem was tracked to
the point where the team had initially checked the combinations of maximum size and worked our way down. It was discovered 
that with the larger sized variations, no combination was discovered in time that satisfied the cost requirement, returning
an empty vector; this was solved by reversing the order and beginning with combinations of size 1 and working our way up.
