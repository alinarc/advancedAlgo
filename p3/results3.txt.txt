For this assignment, we used AMPL to formulate the knapsack and graph coloring probelms as linear programming 
problems to be solved by CPLEX.

Project 3a
----------
Solving the knapsack problem using AMPL proved fairly straightforward. We simply had to declare a vector of 
binary variables of the size of the knapsack instance, specify the objective to maximize (
